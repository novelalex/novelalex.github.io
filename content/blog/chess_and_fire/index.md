Me and a few friends planned to make a [game](https://zoeeechu.itch.io/pyro-check) 
for [TOJam 2024: Talk About Fourshadowing](https://www.tojam.ca/). 

We ended up agreeing on a game of chess but with a twist, the player would be able to use items that don't belong in 
chess to change the game in interesting ways. The player could grab a lighter and set on of the pieces on fire, or roll 
dice and teleport a piece.
