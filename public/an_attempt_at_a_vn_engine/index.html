    <p>[WIP]</p>
<p>A visual novel is a type of game, where you read a lot of text, and (optionally) interact with things.</p>
<p>There are also visuals.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be visuals&hellip;</p>
<p>More on that later, I wanted to create a way for non-programmers to create a visual novel based on a simple script, with a syntax that can be read by anyone.</p>
<p>I needed a Domain Specific Language or DSL for short, a DSL is a special kind of language that is kind of like a regular programming language but its made to do a specific task.</p>
<p>For example, Python is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to build almost any software you could think of. On the other hand, Unreal blueprints are a good example of a DSL. It was designed to build logic for video games made inside of Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>I was considering my options, I could write a custom interpreter, or I could try to use Jetbrains MPS as a platform to create my DSL, but I had another option in mind.</p>
<p>At the time, I was messing around with a language called Ruby, it is well a well known language that is used widely&hellip; for web development. Not a lot of folks are using Ruby as an embedded scripting language for games, because although Ruby is a wonderful language to work in, it&rsquo;s not the fastest.</p>
<p>But I was in a unique situation, because unlike most game engines that need their script to run at least once every 16 milliseconds, I only needed the script to be run once(kinda) at the beginning of the program.</p>
