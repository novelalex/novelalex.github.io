    <p>[WIP]</p>
<p>A visual novel is a type of game, where you read a lot of text, and (optionally) interact with things.</p>
<p>There are also visuals.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be visuals.</p>
<p>More on that later&hellip;</p>
<p>I wanted to create a way for non-programmers to create visual novels by writing a simple script, with a syntax that can be read by anyone.</p>
<p>I needed a Domain Specific Language or DSL for short, a DSL is a special kind of language that is kind of like a regular programming language but its made to do a specific task.</p>
<p>For example, Python is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to build almost any software you could think of. On the other hand, Unreal blueprints are a good example of a DSL. It was designed to build logic for video games made inside of Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>I was considering my options, I could write a custom interpreter, or I could try to use Jetbrains MPS as a platform to create my DSL, but I had another option in mind.</p>
<p>At the time, I was messing around with a language called Ruby, which was flexible enough for me to define my own syntax. Ruby is well a well known language that is used widely&hellip; for web development. Not a lot of folks are using Ruby as an embedded scripting language for games, because although Ruby is a wonderful language to work in, it&rsquo;s not the fastest.</p>
<p>But I was in a unique situation, because unlike most game engines that need their scripts to run at least once every 16 milliseconds, I only needed the script to be run once(kinda) at the beginning of the program.</p>
<p>I was ready to use Ruby and C++ to build the engine, before making a graphical application using SDL, I decided to get a text based prototype working in the terminal.</p>






<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#1d2432;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#828b96;font-style:italic">#include</span> <span style="color:#828b96;font-style:italic">&lt;mruby.h&gt;</span><span style="color:#828b96;font-style:italic">   </span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The DSL is using a feature of Ruby called blocks. Blocks are pieces of code that can be given to a function as input, they can be stored for later use. Ruby&rsquo;s syntax for these functions mimics some features of the language and makes it seem as if they were part of the language.</p>
<p>This is what the syntax for writing stories looks like:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff636f">end</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A scene holds a timeline, which is just an array. The timeline contains each description or dialog that appears in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The timeline for the <code>:start</code> scene would look like:</p>
